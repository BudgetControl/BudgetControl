# Security Policy
Security is very important to us. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it as described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, report vulnerabilities through the main repository: [BudgetControl Repo](https://github.com/BudgetControl/BudgetControl/issues).

### Your report should include:
- Microservice name and version
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Any other relevant details

### What to Expect
You should receive an initial acknowledgment within 24 hours in most cases. A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, assess its impact, follow up with any questions, and coordinate the fix and release process.

The fix will be applied to all supported stable branches, tested, and included in the next security release. The vulnerability will be publicly disclosed after the release. As a thank you, weâ€™ll also acknowledge your contribution.
